 Naive Bayes Classifier Project

Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier using Python and scikit-learn. The goal is to classify text messages as "spam" or "not spam" based on their content.

Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive-bayes-classifier.git
cd naive-bayes-classifier
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/naive_bayes_demo.ipynb
```

Dataset
We'll use a simplified dataset of text messages labeled as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). You can replace `spam_emails.csv` with any similar dataset.

Next Steps
- Add visualization of word frequencies
- Include evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Try different preprocessing techniques (stemming, lemmatization)
